    "Simply by looking at the average height and weight of each team across the years, it seems to have little affect on their final ranking for the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "I attribute this to a couple reasons\n",
    "1. Most teams have tall players\n",
    "2. Averaging the team could make two very different teams seem equal: one where are all more or less the average height, and one where there are lots of very tall and very short people.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to take this a step further, I would compare the heights and weights of each player given their position. This would solve the issues above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, clustering is pretty useless on these plots. The higher ranked teams are clustered closer together than the lower ranked teams, but in most cases they have the same height or weight. So it appears that feature has little affect on the clustering."
